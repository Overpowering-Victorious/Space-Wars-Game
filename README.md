Hello Earthlings !! 😁

This is a Web Application Game named Space Wars, developed in JavaScript and Phaser(framework). You just need to shoot enemies collect as many points as you can with powerups to assist you 😃, but be careful as the enemy shoots at you and you might get trapped 😈.
Hope you enjoy it 😊.
